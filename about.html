        <div class="about-content">
            <p>For thousands of years, we've been quietly (and sometimes very loudly) raising dragons of every shape, size, and temperament imaginable. 
            </br>From pocket-sized emberlings to rare, sky darkening ancients, our dragons are known for their exceptional health, gentle training, and legendary lineage.
            </br>We believe every dragon deserves a good home, and every dragon keeper deserves the perfect match. 
            </br>That's why we obsess over care, ethics, and preservation, ensuring each dragon is raised with respect, patience, and just the right amount of magic.
            </br>Our company is run by a devoted team of dragonkeepers, wyrm-scholars, fire-tenders, and scale-smiths, all bound by a shared love of these magnificent creatures and a few ancient oaths we legally cannot discuss.
            </br>Whether you're seeking a loyal hearth guardian, a rare celestial breed, or a lifelong winged companion, you're holding centuries of knowledge, and a little dragon fire, in your hands.
        </p>
